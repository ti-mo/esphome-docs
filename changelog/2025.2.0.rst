**🎉 Happy New Year! 🎉**

We're kicking off 2025 with a number of updates, several of which are focused on removing old code. Unfortunately,
this means we have a few breaking changes, but this work helps keep ESPHome more maintainable in the long-run.

Join us below for the ESPHome New Year Release Party.

Removal of "old style" Platform Configuration
---------------------------------------------

`Three years ago <https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/2303>`__, we added support for using
`ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/>`__ directly (as an alternative to Arduino). This brought about a
number of benefits and a new syntax was introduced to facilitate greater flexibility when specifying and configuring
your microcontroller/board.

In this release, we've removed support for the "old style" of configuring your microcontroller/board. If you're still
using it, you'll need to update your configurations to use the new style. A brief explanation is
`here <https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/8118>`__, but for more detail, please see the
:ref:`documentation for your microcontroller platform <devices>`.

Removal of Custom Components
----------------------------

Custom components were deprecated over a year ago and, as promised, support for them was removed in this release. We
encourage all developers to migrate their custom components to :doc:`/components/external_components`. Please see
:ref:`a_note_about_custom_components` for a detailed explanation and next steps.

Removal of ``armv7`` Docker Support
-----------------------------------

ESPHome no longer supports ``armv7`` hardware. This is due to both waning support as it relates to tooling and
performance reasons. We strongly recommend moving to a more modern architecture, especially if you're using the ESPHome
Device Builder to build/compile firmware for your devices.

``esp32_rmt`` Updates
---------------------

Components which utilize the RMT hardware found on the ESP32 and its variants have been updated to use the new
interface available in `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/>`__ versions 5 and above. This eliminates
related warnings seen in the compiler logs while building ESPHome configurations. In most cases, you won't notice any
difference, but this change could result in some issues, particularly for :doc:`/components/external_components`. You
may need to make a minor change or two in your device configurations; the configuration validator will tell you if this
is necessary as you update your devices.

Audio Components
----------------

This release includes support for a number of new audio-related components/hardware. These are primarily aimed at
supporting hardware found in Espressif's S3-Box series of products, eliminating the need to use the
`ESP-ADF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf/>`__ and thus offering better integration with ESPHome in general. If
you're using an S3-Box (or one of the variants), we strongly recommend updating your device either OTA or by using our
:doc:`/projects/index` web installer. If you have "taken control" of or "adopted" your S3-Box, we strongly recommend
updating your device's local configuration based on our updated configuration files found
`here <https://github.com/esphome/wake-word-voice-assistants>`__.

In addition, new ``speaker`` components have been introduced to provide more advanced functionality when using
:doc:`/components/voice_assistant`. These components extend our work to help you create the ultimate personal voice
assistant hardware.

The new :doc:`speaker media player </components/media_player/speaker>` component adds several features for building
a well-rounded audio device. It supports playing two different streams of audio: one for announcements and another
for music.

The new :doc:`mixer speaker </components/speaker/mixer>` component lets you combine the two streams. The mixer
even supports audio ducking, so you can lower the volume of the music while your announcement plays!

Image Components
----------------

This release adds support for alpha-blending images when using LVGL. To facilitate this, the ``use_transparency``
configuration variable in :doc:`/components/image` and related components was renamed to ``transparency`` and changed
from a boolean to an enum; in addition, the ``type`` configuration variable is now mandatory. See the
:doc:`/components/image` documentation for more detail.

Finally, the :doc:`/components/online_image` was updated to add support for both BMP and JPEG image formats.

ILI9XXX Display Component
-------------------------

There are two changes to the :doc:`/components/display/ili9xxx` component. Previously the component automatically loaded
the ``psram`` component - this has been removed, and you must now explicitly include the
``psram`` component in your configuration if your display requires it. The bit-depth defaults to 16 bit as before, but
there is no attempt to automatically fallback to 8 bit if insufficient memory is available. You must now explicitly
select 8-bit mode with the ``color_palette`` configuration variable if required.

The symptoms caused by these changes are likely to be a blank screen or a screen that is not displaying correctly. Check
the runtime logs for any errors or warnings that may indicate the cause of the issue, specifically memory allocation
failures.
